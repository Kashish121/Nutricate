# Nutricate
NUTRICATE = NUTRItion + eduCATE

## AIM:
NUTRICATE aims to provide an interactive app using Human Computer
Interaction for diabetic patients to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle.
## SCOPE:
Due to increase in cases of diabetes among every age group, there is a need for
people to live a generic and healthy lifestyle to maintain their diabetic level and
prevent any risk of future diseases arising from diabetes. Henceforth, we hope
to develop a fully functioning app which assists people with their and their
relatives with diabetic problems.
## OBJECTIVE:
The basic idea of the app is to provide its user an interface where they can
search for various foods and fruits and their diabetic information like glucose
content, etc. It suggests appropriate modifications in diet and monitoring food
intake can help in proper management of diabetes along with weight
management and blood sugar level management. Although insulin and oral
medications are frequently required yet nutrition treatment remains an
important tool in management of this disease and should not be neglected.
We prescribe that nourishment treatment for individuals with diabetes ought to
be individualized, with thought given to the person's typical nourishment and
dietary patterns, metabolic profile, treatment objectives, and wanted results.
Additionally, checking of metabolic parameters, including glucose, body weight,
etc. when suitable, just as personal satisfaction, are basic to
survey the requirement for changes in treatment and to guarantee effective
results.
